Clipppy does automatically some of the things you're fed up with while trying
(very hard) not to be annoying in the meantime.

Get it from PyPI:
```shell
pip install clipppy
```
This will (try to make sure) you have installed the
dependencies ([`pyro-ppl`](https://pyro.ai/), and hence
[`torch`](https://pytorch.org/), among others). Once that's done,
[Read the Docs!](https://clipppy.readthedocs.org) to get started.
